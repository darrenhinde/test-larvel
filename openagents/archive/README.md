## 🗂️ **Why Archive?**

These documents were valuable during development but are no longer needed for day-to-day use:

1. **Planning docs** - Implementation is complete
2. **Implementation notes** - Captured in CHANGELOG
3. **Old summaries** - Information consolidated into current docs

We keep them archived for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding design decisions
- Learning from the development process
